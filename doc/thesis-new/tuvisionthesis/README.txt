In this folder you find the template for a thesis written at the TUVision institute.

If you are not using TikZ, take the file thesis.tex as starting point.

If you are using TikZ, take the file thesis_externalTikZ.tex as a starting point.
This file is prepared for compiling TikZ files only when they have changed and it compiles them in seperate processes, which is necessary for big pictures.
When using this file, be sure to include --shell-escape into the command line when compiling the thesis.
You can find more information about exporting Matlab figures to TikZ and about the external compilation on https://tux.ti1.tu-harburg.de/moin/Matlab2Tikz.

If you have questions, feel free to ask Sven Painer.
