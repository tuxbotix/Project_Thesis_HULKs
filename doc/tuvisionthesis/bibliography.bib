abstract = "For measuring machines and machine tools, geometrical accuracy is a key performance criterion. While numerical compensation is well established for CMMs, it is increasingly used on machine tools in addition to mechanical accuracy. This paper is an update on the CIRP keynote paper by Sartori and Zhang from 1995 [Sartori S, Zhang GX (1995) Geometric error measurement and compensation of machines, Annals of the CIRP 44(2):599–609]. Since then, numerical error compensation has gained immense importance for precision machining. This paper reviews the fundamentals of numerical error compensation and the available methods for measuring the geometrical errors of a machine. It discusses the uncertainties involved in different mapping methods and their application characteristics. Furthermore, the challenges for the use of numerical compensation for manufacturing machines are specified. Based on technology and market development, this work aims at giving a perspective for the role of numerical compensation in the future."

abstract = "The paper deals with geometric calibration of industrial robots and focuses on reduction of the measurement noise impact by means of proper selection of the manipulator configurations in calibration experiments. Particular attention is paid to the enhancement of measurement and optimization techniques employed in geometric parameter identification. The developed method implements a complete and irreducible geometric model for serial manipulator, which takes into account different sources of errors (link lengths, joint offsets, etc). In contrast to other works, a new industry-oriented performance measure is proposed for optimal measurement configuration selection that improves the existing techniques via using the direct measurement data only. This new approach is aimed at finding the calibration configurations that ensure the best robot positioning accuracy after geometric error compensation. Experimental study of heavy industrial robot KUKA KR-270 illustrates the benefits of the developed pose strategy technique and the corresponding accuracy improvement."

abstract="In this paper, we propose an algorithm to determine optimal measurement configurations for self-calibrating a robotic visual inspection system with multiple point constraints. The algorithm aims to improve the robotic visual inspection system's calibration accuracy. To do so, a pre-calibration of the robotic visual inspection system is needed to obtain the hand-eye and robot exterior relationship to implement the inverse kinematic algorithm. The candidate measurement configurations with one point constraint can be obtained using the inverse kinematic algorithm for the robotic visual inspection system, so DETMAX is implemented to determine a given number of optimal measurement configurations from the candidate measurement configurations. Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the positions of the multiple points one by one. To verify the efficiency of the proposed approach, experiment evaluation is conducted on a robotic visual inspection system.",

Algorithms dedicated to such problems have been developed and compared, such as the Expected Improvement algorithm (El) or the Informational Approach to Global Optimization (IAGO). However, the influence of noisy evaluation results on the outcome of these comparisons has often been neglected, despite its frequent appearance in industrial problems. In this paper, empirical convergence rates for El and IAGO are compared when an additive noise corrupts the result of an evaluation. IAGO appears more efficient than El and various modifications of El designed to deal with noisy evaluations. Keywords.

With its height of 0.57 m and its weight about 4.5 kg, this innovative robot is lightweight and compact. It distinguishes itself from its existing Japanese, American, and other counterparts thanks to its pelvis kinematics design, its proprietary actuation system based on brush {DC} motors, its electronic, computer and distributed software architectures. This robot has been designed to be affordable without sacrificing quality and performance. It is an open and easy-to-handle platform where the user can change all the embedded system software or just add some applications to make the robot adopt specific behaviours. The robot's head and forearms are modular and can be changed to promote further evolution. The comprehensive and functional design is one of the reasons that helped select {NAO} to replace the {AIBO} quadrupeds in the 2008 {RoboCup} standard league.},
